            <h2>Passion Reignited by Nostalgia</h2>
            <p>
                Local Teas started as a passion project of its owner, Mrs Idowu Baku. Ever since she was a child growing up in the plains of Plateau state, she has loved tea; its taste, its smell, its calming effect and health benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                At her home in Kano, she started planting tea ingredients, so she could drink them fresh, just like she used to back home. Mrs Baku was surprised to find out that the difference between freshly made tea and store-bought ones was so much.</p>
            <p>
                Her co-workers started asking how she always had nice smelling tea to work and where she got it from. 
                Soon, they started to place orders and Mrs Baku found that she had become a tea farmer, right in her home! 
                That's how Local Teas was born!
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been 12 years since that first experiment and Local Teas has expanded to serving customers within and outside Nigeria.
                We now have farms all over Nigeria, ensuring that wherever you are, delivery times stay short and your get your tea fresh.
            </p>
            <p>
                No processing is involved and no chemicals are used. Our teas come straight from the earth, as nature designed it. Isn't that wonderful?
